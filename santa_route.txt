Potential Locations along Santa's Route

Rules: Santa arrives between midnight and 4am in a location's local time, and the route must be fluid. Locations can be cut if they don't fit but we want as many locations as makes sense. Larger cities could take up to 5 minutes to deliever all presents while smaller locations take up to 1-3 minutes depending on size. All times must be in UTC for program interpretation.

KEEP TIMING FLUID WHERE THERE IS ALWAYS A NEXT STOP WITHIN 5-10 minutes. For Arrival and Departure times take into account sped up travel times.
