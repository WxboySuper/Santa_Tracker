Santa Tracker: Cinematic Logic Specification

Core Philosophy

"The Magic Over The Math."
The primary goal is viewer engagement. We prioritize smooth geographical paths and exciting visuals over strict timezone adherence.

1. The Timeline & "The Window"

We calculate validity based on Local Arrival Time.

Target Window (The Sweet Spot)

Green (Ideal): 11:00 PM (23:00) — 2:00 AM (02:00)

Narrative: Everyone is asleep; Santa is in the zone.

Yellow (Warning):

Early: 10:30 PM — 11:00 PM

Late: 2:00 AM — 3:30 AM

Narrative: Valid, but risky. Used for "Leniency" hops (e.g., short island jumps).

Red (Broken):

Before 10:30 PM (Risk when Kids are possibly awake).

After 3:30 AM (Early risers/Sunlight risk).

Phase 1: The Hype Build (Launch)

Start Location: North Pole.

Target: First Delivery Node (e.g., Kiritimati).

Logic: The start time at the North Pole is back-calculated.

If First Delivery is 00:00 UTC+14.

And Travel Time is ~9 minutes.

North Pole Departure = ~23:51 UTC+14 (previous day).

Visuals: Maximum Cinematic Zoom. Santa is "Deploying."

2. Stop Types & Pacing

The "Stop Duration" is a narrative tool, not a logistical one.

Stop Type

Duration

Use Case

Standard

60s

Default for 90% of locations.

Major

120s

Major Metros (London, NYC, Tokyo). Allows viewer to read facts.

Flyby

0s

Dense clusters/neighborhoods. He drops presents without stopping.

Refuel/Rest

300s+

(Optional) "Cookie Break" to reset time if he gets too far ahead.

3. The Camera Director (Auto-Zoom)

The zoom level is dictated by the Action State, not just the user.

State A: The Delivery (Stop)

Action: Arrived at node.

Zoom: High (City/Street Level).

Focus: The Sleigh, the counter ticking up, local facts.

State B: Short Hop (Inter-Island/Region)

Action: Local and Regional Travle.

Zoom: Medium (Region Level).

Focus: Seeing the path to the immediate next target.

State C: Long Haul (Ocean Crossing)

Action: Long haul Travel (supersonic and hypersonic).

Zoom: Low (Globe/Curvature Level).

Focus: The grandeur of the flight. Allows Santa to move "faster" visually.

Note: User can toggle "Manual Mode" to override this, but "Auto" is default.
